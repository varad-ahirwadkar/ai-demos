# NeMo Guardrails Demo - TechGear Electronics Store Assistant

A guardrail is a semi or fully deterministic control that restricts or guides LLM behavior. Guardrails can block specific topics, steer conversations, or trigger actions such as escalating to a human.

NeMo Guardrails is an open source toolkit for managing LLM behavior at runtime. It uses a rule-based language called Colang to define conversation flows, restrict topics, and enforce policies. The framework is LLM agnostic and designed for low latency deployments, including GPU-accelerated environments.

## Demo Overview

This demo showcases a simple **e-commerce scenario** for **TechGear Electronics**, and shows how NeMo Guardrails can be used to keep interactions safe, relevant, and on-brand.  

This demo uses an **instructions-based** approach, where product information is embedded directly in the bot's instructions. The LLM generates natural responses from this context, without relying on predefined flows, while guardrails ensure interactions remain safe and within scope.

The configuration utilizes a `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` model deployed via KServe, integrated with input and output guardrails to ensure safe, accurate, and on-brand customer interactions.

## How It Works

```
User Input
    ↓
Input Guardrails (PII, length, content, competitor, scope)
    ↓
Flow Matching (greeting → predefined | other → general)
    ↓
LLM Generation (uses instructions + sample conversations)
    ↓
Output Guardrails (PII masking)
    ↓
Response
```

### Prerequisites  

Enable TrustyAI by following:  [Configure the RHOAI for RawDeployment](../README.md)

### 1. Model Configuration

We will be deploying the `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` model and use it as self-hosted vLLM backend (with an OpenAI-compatible API) for NeMo Guardrails.

#### Deploy the Model
Create and switch to the demo project:
```bash
oc new-project trustyai-demo || oc project trustyai-demo
```

Deploy the vLLM runtime and model:
```bash
oc process -n redhat-ods-applications vllm-cpu-runtime-template | oc create -f -
oc apply -f ../common/vllm-deployment/qwen.yaml
```

Wait for the model pod to be ready, for example `qwen-predictor-XXXXXX`

Test the raw model endpoint:
```bash
RAW_MODEL=https://$(oc get route qwen -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
curl -ks -X POST "$RAW_MODEL/v1/completions" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen",
    "prompt": "The capital of France is",
    "max_tokens": 20
  }' | jq
```

### 2. Configure NeMo Guardrails

#### 2.1 Create a OPENAI token secret:
> **Note:** For demo purposes, you can use any string value as the token (e.g., "demo-token").
```bash
oc create secret generic openai-key-secret --from-literal=token=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
```

#### 2.2 Create the Guardrails Configuration
For this demo, everything is bundled into a single [nemo-config](configurations/configmap.yml) ConfigMap, which includes:  
**Configuration Files:**
```
config/
├── config.yaml
├── rails.co
└── actions.py
```

#### 2.2.1 config.yaml
This includes `instructions`, `sample conversations`, `model configuration`, and `rails config`:

**Instructions (Bot Context with Product Catalog)**

```yaml
instructions:
  - type: general
    content: |
      TechGear Electronics Assistant
      
      PRODUCTS:
      1. TechGear Pro 15 Laptop - $1,299 (i7, 16GB RAM, RTX 4060)
      2. TechGear Phone X1 - $899 (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 120Hz AMOLED)
      
      POLICIES: Free shipping >$50, 30-day returns, 1-3yr warranty
```

> **Note:** Product information is embedded in instructions (no RAG/knowledge base). Suitable for small catalogs (2-10 products).

**Sample Conversations**

Guide the LLM's response style with examples:
```yaml
sample_conversation: |
  user "What products do you have?"
    ask general question
  bot provide response
    "We offer two excellent products: TechGear Pro 15 laptop for $1,299..."
```

**Model Configuration**

```yaml
models:
  - type: main
    engine: vllm_openai
    parameters:
      openai_api_base: "http://qwen-predictor.trustyai-demo.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1"
      model_name: "qwen"
```

Where,
```
- type: main            # Identifies the primary LLM used for conversations
- engine: vllm_openai   # Uses a self-hosted vLLM backend with an OpenAI-compatible API
- parameters            # Provider-specific connection details, including the model endpoint and name
```

For more information please refer [#models-configuration](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/latest/configure-rails/configuration-reference.html#models-configuration)

**Rails Config:**  
Built-in Microsoft Presidio integration for PII detection:
```yaml
  config:
    sensitive_data_detection:
      input:
        entities:
          - PERSON
          - EMAIL_ADDRESS
          - PHONE_NUMBER
          - CREDIT_CARD
      output:
        entities:
          - PERSON
          - EMAIL_ADDRESS
          - PHONE_NUMBER
          - CREDIT_CARD
```

**Input Rails**  
Run before the LLM is invoked to validate, filter, and modify user input
```yaml
  input:
    flows:
      - detect sensitive data on input
      - check message length
      - check forbidden content
      - check competitor mentions
      - check out of scope requests
```
**Input Guardrails:**  
- **PII Detection**: Blocks sensitive personal information
- **Message Length**: Enforces 100-word limit for better responses
- **Content Filtering**: Blocks profanity, violence, illegal activities
- **Competitor Blocking**: Redirects mentions of Apple, Samsung, Dell, etc.
- **Scope Validation**: Blocks medical, legal, political, financial advice

**Output Rails**  
Run after the LLM responds to validate and filter bot responses
```yaml
  output:
    flows:
      - detect sensitive data on output
```
**Output Guardrails:**
- **PII Masking**: Prevents leaking personal information in responses

#### 2.2.2 rails.co (Colang Flows):
A Colang script is a `.co` file composed of flow definitions. Each flow describes the desired interaction between the user and the bot.

**1. Greeting Flow** (Predefined Responses)
```colang
define flow greeting
  user express greeting
  bot express greeting
  bot introduce store
```

**2. General Conversation Flow** (LLM-Generated)
```colang
define flow general conversation
  user ask general question  # "..." wildcard matches any input
  bot provide response       # Undefined → triggers LLM
```

**3. Guardrail Flows** (Deterministic Checks)
- `check competitor mentions` - Blocks competitor brands
- `check out of scope requests` - Blocks off-topic keywords
- `check message length` - 100-word limit
- `check forbidden content` - Profanity/violence filter
- `detect sensitive data` - PII detection (built-in)


See the complete Colang flows in [configurations/configmap.yml](configurations/configmap.yml)

Reference: [NeMo Guardrails Colang Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/latest/configure-rails/colang/colang-2/getting-started/index.html)

#### 2.2.3 actions.py (Custom Actions):

Custom Python actions implement deterministic checks and business logic:

**Custom Actions** (Deterministic Python Functions):
- `check_message_length()` - 100-word limit
- `check_forbidden_content()` - Profanity/violence filter
- `check_competitor_mentions()` - Blocks: Apple, Samsung, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, Microsoft Surface, Google Pixel, OnePlus, Xiaomi, MacBook, iPhone, Galaxy
- `check_out_of_scope()` - Blocks: medical, health, legal, political, financial topics


**Apply the ConfigMap:**

```bash
oc apply -f configurations/configmap.yml
```

#### 2.3 Create the NeMo Guardrails Custom Resource

```bash
oc create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: trustyai.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1
kind: NemoGuardrails
metadata:
  name: nemo-guardrails-cr
  annotations:
    security.opendatahub.io/enable-auth: 'false'  # Disabled for demo purposes only
spec:
  nemoConfigs:
    - name: config
      default: true
      configMaps:
        - nemo-config
  env:
    - name: "OPENAI_API_KEY"
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: "openai-key-secret"
          key: "token"
EOF
```

The operator mounts the ConfigMap to `/app/config/config/`
Final structure:
```
  /app/config/config/
  ├── config.yaml
  ├── rails.co
  └── actions.py
```

#### ❗NOTE: Temporary image override:
At the time of this demo, an official image with the multi-architecture support is not yet available, so a custom image is used instead.
This override should be removed once an official NeMo Guardrails image is available and published.
> **Note:** Replace `<custom-image>` with your actual custom NeMo Guardrails image reference.
```bash
oc patch deployment nemo-guardrails-cr   -p '{
    "spec": {
      "template": {
        "spec": {
          "containers": [
            {
              "name": "nemo-guardrails",
              "image": "<custom-image>"
            }
          ],
          "initContainers": [
            {
              "name": "ca-bundle-initializer",
              "image": "<custom-image>"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```
#### ❗NOTE: Increase route timeout: 
OpenShift routes have a default timeout of 30 seconds.
NeMo Guardrails may exceed this limit due to multiple guardrail checks and LLM inference latency.  
Tune the timeout according to your model size and expected response times.
```bash
oc annotate route nemo-guardrails-cr --overwrite haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=10m
```

### 3. Testing the TechGear Electronics Assistant

Set the Guardrails route:
```bash
GUARDRAILS_ROUTE=https://$(oc get routes/nemo-guardrails-cr -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')
```
