# TrustyAI Lemonade Stand Demo

In this example, we'll imagine we run a successful lemonade stand and want to deploy a customer service
agent so our customers can learn more about our products. We'll want to make sure all conversations with
the agent are family friendly, and that it does not promote our rival fruit juice vendors. 

---
### Prerequisites  

Enable TrustyAI as a prerequisite by following these instructions - [Configure the RHOAI for RawDeployment](../README.md)

### 1. Deploy Phi3 Model
```bash
oc new-project trustyai-demo || oc project trustyai-demo
```

Create the [s3-secret](common/setup/s3-secret.yaml) with creds.
```
oc apply -f common/setup/s3-secret.yaml
```

Deploy the model
```
oc process -n redhat-ods-applications vllm-cpu-runtime-template | oc create -f -
oc apply -f common/setup/vllm-deployment/phi3.yaml
```

Wait for the model pod to spin up, should look something like `phi3-predictor-XXXXXX`


Then, in a new terminal tab, we can send some prompts to the model via the included `prompt.py` helper script.
```bash
curl -ks -X POST "https://phi3-trustyai-demo.apps.rdr-varad-418.ocp-rhoai.com/v1/chat/completions"   -H 'accept: application/json'   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -d '{
    "model": "phi3",
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": "The capital of France is",
        "role": "user"
      }
]}' | jq
````

### 2. Guardrails
In the following section, we'll walk through the configurations that have been provided inside of the `guardrails` folder. Everything is already written for you, so there's no need to add anything to the yaml files unless you're trying to experiment!


#### 2.1 Deploy the Hateful And Profane (HAP) language detector
This will use IBM's [granite-guardian-hap-125m](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-guardian-hap-125m) model, which is a small model.

```bash
oc process -n redhat-ods-applications guardrails-detector-huggingface-serving-template | oc create -f -
oc apply -f guardrails/hap_detector/hap.yaml
```
Wait for the `guardrails-detector-ibm-hap-predictor-xxx` pod to spin up


#### 2.2) Configure the Guardrails Orchestrator
Open `guardrails/configmap_orchestrator.yaml`. This is our configuration for the guardrails orchestrator:

```yaml
  config.yaml: |
    chat_generation:
      service:
        hostname: phi3-predictor.trustyai-demo.svc.cluster.local
        port: 8080
    detectors:
      regex_competitor:
        type: text_contents
        service:
            hostname: "127.0.0.1"
            port: 8080
        chunker_id: whole_doc_chunker
        default_threshold: 0.5
      hap:
        type: text_contents
        service:
          hostname: guardrails-detector-ibm-hap-predictor.trustyai-demo.svc.cluster.local
          port: 8000
        chunker_id: whole_doc_chunker
        default_threshold: 0.5
```

Here, we've defined the location of our `chat_generation` model server, and the locations of our detector servers. The `hap` detector is reachable via the service that is created by the KServe deployment (`phi3-predictor.trustyai-demo.svc.cluster.local`), while our regex detector sidecar will be launched at `localhost:8080`- this will always be the case when using the regex detector sidecar. 


#### 2.3) Configure our regex detector
Open `guardrails/configmap_vllm_gateway.yaml`. This is where we can configure our local detectors and our "preset" guardrailing pipeines. 

On line 19, we've used the following regex pattern to filter out converstations about our rival juice vendors:
```regexp
\b(?i:apple|cranberry|grape|orange|pineapple|)\b
```
This will flag anything that matches that regex pattern as a detection- in this case, any mention of the words `apple`, `cranberry`, `grape`, `orange`, or `pineapple` regardless of case.


#### 2.4) Configure the Guardrails Gateway
Again, looking inside  `guardrails/configmap_vllm_gateway.yaml`:

The guardrails gateway provides two main features:
1) It provides the OpenAI `v1/chat/completions` API, which lets you hotswap between unguardrailed and guardrailed models
2) It lets you create guardrail "presets" baked into the endpoint.

#### Detectors 
First, we've set up the detectors that we want to use:
```yaml
 detectors:
  - name: regex_competitor
    input: true
    output: true
    detector_params:
      regex:    
        - \b(?i:orange|apple|cranberry|pineapple|grape)\b
  - name: hap
    input: true
    output: true
    detector_params: {}
```
Here, we've referred to the two detector names we created in the Orchestrator Configuration (`hap` and `regex_competitor`).
For both detectors, we specify `input: true` and `output: true`, meaning we will use them for both input and output
detectors. If you want to run a detector on only input or only output, you can change these flags. Finally, for the `regex_competitor`
detector, we define the specific regex that we described earlier.

#### Defining Presets
Next, we've created three preset pipelines for those detectors:
```yaml
routes:
  - name: all
    detectors:
      - regex_competitor
      - hap
  - name: hap
    detectors:
      - hap
  - name: passthrough
    detectors:
```
First is `all`, which will be served at `$GUARDRAILS_GATEWAY_URL/all/v1/chat/completions`, which will use both the `regex_competitor` and `hap` detectors. Next is `hap` will just uses the `hap` detector, and finally we have the `passthrough` preset, which does not use any detectors. 

### 2.5) Applying the ConfigMaps
Now that we've explored the configuration, let's deploy the configmap:
```bash
oc apply -f guardrails/configmap_vllm_gateway.yaml
```

Now, we can apply the final two configmaps needed to configure the orchestrator:
```bash
oc apply -f guardrails/configmap_orchestrator.yaml
```

### 2.6) Deploy the Orchestrator
```bash
oc apply -f guardrails/orchestrator_cr.yaml
```

### 2.7) Check the Orchestrator Health
```bash
ORCH_ROUTE_HEALTH=$(oc get routes guardrails-orchestrator-health -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
curl -sk https://$ORCH_ROUTE_HEALTH/info | jq
```
If everything is okay, it should return:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "openai": {
      "status": "HEALTHY"
    },
    "hap": {
      "status": "HEALTHY"
    },
    "regex_competitor": {
      "status": "HEALTHY"
    }
  }
}
```

---
### 3. Have a play around with Guardrails!
```bash
GUARDRAILS_GATEWAY=https://$(oc get routes guardrails-orchestrator-gateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
RAW_MODEL=https://$(oc get route phi3 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

#### ❗NOTE: Increase the HTTP route's default timeout by adding following annotation to the gateway route : 
```
oc annotate route guardrails-orchestrator-gateway --overwrite haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=10m
```

The available endpoints are:

- `$GUARDRAILS_GATEWAY/passthrough`: query the raw, unguardrailed model. 
- `$GUARDRAILS_GATEWAY/hap`: query using with the HAP detector.
- `$GUARDRAILS_GATEWAY/all`: query with all available detectors, so the HAP and competitor-check detectors. 


Some cool queries to try:

Opt for 100% fruit juice without added sugars.\n\n\n2. **Cranberry Juice** - Rich in antioxidants and vitamins, cranberry juice can be good for urinary tract health and has anti-inflammatory properties. Just look for natural varieties without added sugars.\n\n\n3. **Watermelon Juice** - A hydrating option packed with vitamins (C and B5) and has mild diuretic properties. Full of water, it's beneficial for summer hydration.\n\n\n4. **Orange Juice** - A strong source of vitamin C and folate; especially with the peel, since it contains fiber and is less processed. Unsweetened or low-sugar varieties are best.\n\n\n5. **Pineapple Juice** - Loaded with bromelain, an enzyme that is beneficial for digestion. It's also a source of vitamin C and manganese.\n\n\n6. **Grape Juice** - Offers vitamin C and numerous phytonutrients. Grape juice can also aid digestion when consumed with meals due to its high acidity.\n\n\nRemember, while fruit juices can be part of a healthy diet when chosen wisely and consumed in moderation, whole fruits are generally preferable due to their fiber content which aids in digestion and satiety.",
